# Bank Marketing Case Study

This project is a classification problem related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or a ('no') subscription.
